📌 Project Title
Compatibility Testing of a Basic Web Page – Manual Testing Project

📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing manual compatibility testing on a basic web page to ensure that the application works consistently across different browsers, devices, and screen sizes.
The primary goal is to identify layout issues, broken links, and functional inconsistencies that may occur due to variations in browsers and devices.
The testing was conducted manually to gain real-world experience in cross-browser and cross-device testing, which is a critical aspect of ensuring a smooth user experience.

🎯 Objectives


To verify web page compatibility across multiple browsers


To test UI responsiveness on different devices


To identify layout distortions and UI alignment issues


To validate functionality consistency across environments


To document issues and suggest fixes in Markdown format



🛠 Testing Approach
The testing followed a manual testing methodology and was carried out using real devices and browsers without any automation tools.
Steps followed:


Selection of test browsers and devices


Execution of test scenarios manually


Observation of UI and functional behavior


Identification of compatibility issues


Documentation of findings and recommendations
